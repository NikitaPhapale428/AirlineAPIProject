# AirlineAPIProject
This project is a Spring Boot-based REST API application designed to process and transform airline-related data. It provides endpoints for handling complex airline request and response structures, enabling seamless communication between front-end systems and airline data services.

REST API Development:
Endpoints like /api/airline/transform for handling airline request payloads and returning transformed responses.
JSON-based data handling with DTOs for clear structure and validation.
